# UI Principles

## Hierarchy
- Establish a clear primary focal point per section.
- Use scale, weight, and spacing to separate primary, secondary, and tertiary content.
- Limit competing accents; one dominant accent color per view is usually enough.

## Layout Rhythm
- Use a consistent grid and gutter; avoid ad-hoc alignment.
- Create a predictable vertical rhythm with repeating section spacing.
- Favor fewer, larger sections over many tiny ones.

## Typography
- Use 1-2 typefaces and a limited set of sizes (4-6 steps).
- Keep body line length around 55-75 characters on desktop.
- Pair heavier weights with generous line height for legibility.

## Composition
- Use proximity to show relationships and separation to show boundaries.
- Balance density: avoid crowding critical UI and avoid empty wastelands.
- Anchor the layout with one or two strong horizontal bands or shapes.

## Content First
- Let the content drive layout instead of decorative elements.
- Avoid generic hero blocks; tailor the first section to the product story.

## Inputs
- in general for blocks or part with multiples inputs, do not leave blank spaces between them, make them well compacted.
- in select inputs use full width space or some constant size dont fit based on content.
